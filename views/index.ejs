    <h3 class="title">My Toolkit</h3>
    <hr>
		<p>Over the past few years, I've worked hard to develop a well-rounded skillset to <br> take on a variety of development challenges (including front-end and back-end) <br>
    and think outside to box to find unique solutions to complex problems.</p>

    <ul class="grid">
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-code fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>HTML / CSS / JavaScript</h4>
        <p>The "bread and butter" of front-end development. These were the first skills I learned when getting a taste for web development 3 years ago. 
        <br>I've used these three to develop increasingly complex projects during my journey as a developer.</p>
      </li>
			<li>
				<i class="fab fa-react fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>React and Redux</h4>
        <p>I was so excited to learn both React and Redux because of the power they provide in being able to build single page applications. 
        <br>I learned React and Redux through an online bootcamp, and am currently using them to build a project for the fighting game community which I am very excited about.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <i class="fab fa-node fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>Node.js with Express</h4>
        <p>Having worked with JavaScript on the front-end, using Node for learning back-end development was an easy choice.
        By pairing Node with the Express framework, I've become comfortable with writing RESTful routes for all of my website projects.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fas fa-database fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>Mongo DB</h4>
        <p>This "NoSQL, document store" database has been my go-to database since learning node.js. I find it easy to understand, easy to work with, and (above all) reliable. 
        I've used both a local database as well as MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i class="fab fa-adobe fa-4x"></i>
        <h4>Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop</h4>
        <p>Before I ever started my developer journey, I was a graphic designer. I've used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop for 8 years to create designs for both personal
          and professional work.</p>
